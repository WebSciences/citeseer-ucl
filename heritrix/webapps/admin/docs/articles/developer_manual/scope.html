    <sup>[<a href="#ftn.footnote_scope_problems" name="footnote_scope_problems">3</a>]</sup> instance defines which URIs are "in" a particular crawl. It
    is essentially a Filter which determines (actually it subclasses the
    <a href="http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/framework/Filter.html" target="_top">Filter</a>
    class), looking at the totality of information available about a
    CandidateURI/CrawlURI instance, if that URI should be scheduled for
    crawling. Dynamic information inherent in the discovery of the URI, such
    as the path by which it was discovered, may be considered. Dynamic
    information which requires the consultation of external and potentially
    volatile information, such as current robots.txt requests and the history
    of attempts to crawl the same URI, should NOT be considered. Those
    potentially high-latency decisions should be made at another step.</p><p>As with Filters, the scope will be going through a refactoring.
    Because of that we will only briefly describe how to create new Scopes at
    this point.</p><p>All Scopes should subclass the <a href="http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/framework/CrawlScope.html" target="_top">CrawlScope</a>
    class. Instead of overriding the innerAccepts method as you would do if
    you created a filter, the CrawlScope class implements this and instead
    offers several other methods that should be overriden instead. These
    methods acts as different type of filters that the URI will be checked
    against. In addition the CrawlScope class offers a list of exclude filters
    which can be set on every scope. If the URI is accepted (matches the test)
    by any of the filters in the exclude list, it will be considered being out
    of scope. The implementation of the innerAccepts method in the CrawlSope
    is as follows:</p><p><pre class="programlisting">protected final boolean innerAccepts(Object o) {
    return ((isSeed(o) || focusAccepts(o)) || additionalFocusAccepts(o) ||
            transitiveAccepts(o)) &amp;&amp; !excludeAccepts(o);
}</pre></p><p>The result is that the checked URI is considered being inside the
    crawl's scope if it is a seed or is accepted by any of the focusAccepts,
    additionalFocusAccepts or transitiveAccepts, unless it is matched by any
    of the exclude filters.</p><p>When writing your own scope the methods you might want to override
    are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p><a href="http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/framework/CrawlScope.html#focusAccepts(java.lang.Object)" target="_top">focusAccepts(Object)</a>
        the focus filter should rule things in by prima facia/regexp-pattern
        analysis. The typical variants of the focus filter are:<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li><p>broad: accept all</p></li><li><p>domain: accept if on same 'domain' (for some definition)
              as seeds</p></li><li><p>host: accept if on exact host as seeds</p></li><li><p>path: accept if on same host and a shared path-prefix as
              seeds</p></li></ul></div>Heritrix ships with scopes that implement each of
        these variants. An implementation of a new scope might thus be
        subclassing one of these scopes.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/framework/CrawlScope.html#additionalFocusAccepts(java.lang.Object)" target="_top">additionalFocusAccepts(Object)</a></p></li><li><p><a href="http://crawler.archive.org/apidocs/org/archive/crawler/framework/CrawlScope.html#transitiveAccepts(java.lang.Object)" target="_top">transitiveAccepts(Object)</a>
        the transitive filter rule extra items in by dynamic path analysis
        (for example, off site embedded images).</p></li></ul></div><p></p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr align="left" width="100"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a href="#footnote_scope_problems" name="ftn.footnote_scope_problems">3</a>] </sup>It has been identified problems with how the Scopes are defined.
