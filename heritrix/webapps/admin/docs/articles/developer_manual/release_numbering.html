    for Linux kernels. Versions are 3 numbers:</p><p>[major ] .[minor/mode ] .[patchlevel ]</p><p>The major version number, currently at one, increments upon
    significant architectural changes or the achievement of important
    milestones in capabilities. The minor/mode version number increments as
    progress is made within a major version, with the added constraint that
    all external releases have an even minor/mode version number, and all
    internal/development versions have an odd minor/mode version
    number.</p><p>The patchlevel number increments for small sets of changes,
    providing the most fine-grain time line of software evolution. Patchlevels
    increment regularly for internal/development (odd minor level) work, but
    only increment for external releases when an official update to the
    previous release version has been tested and packaged.</p><p>Version numbers are applied as tags of the form
    "heritrix-#_#_#".  Branches occur at major transitions and are labeled
    with the form "heritrix_#_#'.</p><p>When a particular development-version is thought
    appropriate to become an external/"st able" release, it is considered a
    "Release Candidate" (No where is this written in versions). If testing
    confirms it is suitable for release, it is
    assigned the next even minor/mode value (and a zero patchlevel), 
    version-labelled, and packaged for release. Immediately after release, and
    before additional coding occurs, the HEAD is assigned the next odd
    minor/mode value (and a zero patchlevel) in project/source files.</p><p>If patches are required to a released version, before the next
    release is ready, they are applied to a branch from the release
    version tag, tested, and released as the subsequent patchlevel.</p><p>Keep in mind that each version number is an integer, not merely a
    decimal digit. To use an extreme example: development version 2.99.99
    would be followed by either the 2.99.100 development version patchlevel or
    the 2.100.0 release. (And after such a release, the next development
    version would be 2.101.0.)</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table summary="Navigation footer" width="100%"><tr><td align="left" width="40%"><a accesskey="p" href="refactor_frontier_dispositions.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%">&nbsp;</td><td align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="release.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="40%">2.&nbsp;The Frontiers handling of dispositions&nbsp;</td><td align="center" width="20%"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td valign="top" align="right" width="40%">&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Making a Heritrix Release</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
