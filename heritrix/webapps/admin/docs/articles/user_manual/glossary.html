          Mercator provided. In <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/najork01highperformance.html" target="_top">one of
          the papers on Mercator</a> it is described this way:
          &ldquo;<span class="quote">Checkpointing is an important part of any long-running
          process such as a web crawl. By checkpointing we mean writing a
          representation of the crawler's state to stable storage that, in the
          event of a failure, is sufficient to allow the crawler to recover
          its state by reading the checkpoint and to resume crawling from the
          exact state it was in at the time of the checkpoint. By this
          definition, in the event of a failure, any work performed after the
          most recent checkpoint is lost, but none of the work up to the most
          recent checkpoint. In Mercator, the frequency with which the
          background thread performs a checkpoint is user-configurable; we
          typically checkpoint anywhere from 1 to 4 times per
          day.</span>&rdquo;</p><p>See <a href="outside.html#checkpoint" title="9.4.&nbsp;Checkpointing">Section&nbsp;9.4, &ldquo;Checkpointing&rdquo;</a> for discussion of the

          that the crawler will start executing a job as soon as one is made
          available in the pending jobs queue (as long as there is not a job
          already running).</p><p>If the crawler is in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Holding Jobs</em></span>
          mode, jobs added to the pending jobs queue will be held; they will
          not be started, even if there are no jobs currently being
          run.</p></dd><dt>Host</dt><dd><p>A host can serve multiple domains or a single domain can be
          served by multiple hosts. For our purposes so far, host == hostname
          in URI. DNS is not considered; it is volatile and may be
          unavailable. So when Heritrix gets the URIs...<pre class="programlisting">  http://www.example.com
  http://search.example.com
  http://201.199.7.15
</pre>...even if they all point to the 201.199.7.15 IP, they are 3
          different logical hosts (at the level of the URI/HTTP
          protocol).</p><p>Conformant HTTP proxies behave similarly, we think, even if
          they know www.example.com == 201.199.7.15, they will not consider
          them interchangeable.</p><p>This is not ideal for politeness where we'd want politeness
          rules to apply to the physical host rather than the logical.</p></dd><dt><a name="link-hop-count"></a>Link hop count</dt><dd><p>Number of link follow from the seed to the current URI. Seeds

          scope or duplicates. Depending on the implementation of the Frontier
          this might always be zero. It may also be an adjusted number that
          tries to account for duplicates by estimation.</p></dd><dt><a name="politeness"></a>Politeness</dt><dd><p>Politeness refers to attempts by the crawler software to limit
          load on a site. Without politeness restrictions the crawler might
          otherwise overwhelm smaller sites and even cause moderately sized
          sites to slow down significantly.</p><p>Unless you have express permission to crawl a site
          aggressively you should apply strict politeness rules to any
          crawl.</p></dd><dt><a name="queueduris"></a>Queued URIs</dt><dd><p>Number of URIs queued up and waiting for processing.</p><p>This includes any URIs that failed but will be retried.

          a transformation applied to URIs which makes their left-to-right
          representation better match the natural hierarchy of domain
          names.</p><p>A URI &lt;scheme://domain.tld/path?query&gt; has SURT form
          &lt;scheme://(tld,domain,)/path?query&gt;.</p><p>Conversion to SURT form also involves making all characters
          lowercase, and changing the 'https' scheme to 'http'. Further, the
          '/' after a URI authority component -- for example, the third slash
          in a regular HTTP URI -- will only appear in the SURT form if it
          appeared in the plain URI form. (This convention proves important
          when using real URIs as a shorthand for SURT prefixes, as described
          below.)</p><p>SURT form URIs are typically not used to specify exact URIs
          for fetching. Rather, SURT form is useful when comparing or sorting
          URIs. For example, URIs in SURT format sort into natural groups --
          all 'archive.org' URIs will be adjacent, regardless of what
          subdomains like 'books.archive.org' or 'movies.archive.org' are
          used.</p><p>Most importantly, a SURT form URI, or a truncated version of a
          SURT form URI, can be used as a <a href="glossary.html#surtprefix">SURT prefix</a>. A
          SURT prefix will often correspond to all URIs within a common 'area'
          of interest for crawling. For example, the prefix
          &lt;http://(is,&gt; will be shared by all URIs in the '.is'
          top-level domain.</p></dd><dt><a name="surtprefix"></a>SURT prefix</dt><dd><p>A URI in <a href="glossary.html#surt">SURT</a> form, especially if
          truncated, may be of use as a "SURT prefix", a shared prefix string
          of all SURT form URIs in the same 'area' of interest for web
          crawling.</p><p>For example, the prefix &lt;http://(is,&gt; will be shared by
          all SURT form URIs in the '.is' top-level domain. The prefix
          &lt;http://(org,archive,www,)/movies&gt; (which is also a valid full
          SURT form URI) will be shared by all URIs at www.archive.org with a
          path beginning '/movies'.</p><p>A collection of sorted SURT prefixes is an efficient way to
          specify a desired crawl scope: any URI whose SURT form starts with
          any of the prefixes should be included.</p><p>A small set of conventions can be also be used to calculate an
          "implied SURT prefix" from a regular URI, such as a URI supplied as
          a crawl seed. These conventions are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Convert the URI to its SURT form.</p></li><li><p>If there are at least 3 slashes ('/') in the SURT form,
              remove everything after the last slash. As examples,
              &lt;http://(org,example,www,)/main/subsection/&gt; is unchanged;
              &lt;http://(org,example,www,)/main/subsection&gt; is truncated
              to &lt;http://(org,example,www,)/main/&gt;;
              &lt;http://(org,example,www,)/&gt; is unchanged; and
              &lt;http://(org,example,www,)&gt; is unchanged.</p></li><li><p>If the resulting form ends in an off-parenthesis (')'),
              remove the off-parenthesis. So each of the above examples except
              for the last is unchanged, while the last
              &lt;http://(org,example,www,)&gt; becomes
              &lt;http://(org,example,www,&gt;.</p></li></ol></div><p>This allows many seed URIs, in their usual form, to imply the
          most useful SURT prefixes for crawling related URIs -- with the
          presence or absence of a trailing '/' on URIs without further
          path-info being a subtle indicator as to whether subdomains of the
          supplied domain should be included.</p><p>For example, seed &lt;http://www.archive.org/&gt; will become
          SURT form and implied SURT prefix
          &lt;http://(org,archive,www,)/&gt;, and is the prefix of all SURT
          form URIs on www.archive.org. However, any subdomain URI like
          &lt;http://homepages.www.archive.org/directory&gt; would be ruled
          out, because its SURT form
          &lt;http://(org,archive,www,homepages,)/directory&gt; does not begin
          with the full SURT prefix, including the ')/', deduced from the
          seed.</p><p>In contrast, seed &lt;http://www.archive.org&gt; (note the
          lack of trailing slash) will become SURT form
          &lt;http://(org,archive,www,)&gt;, and implied SURT prefix
          &lt;http://(org,archive,www,&gt; (note the lack of trailing ')').
          This will be the prefix of all URIs on www.archive.org, as well as
          any subdomain URIs like
          &lt;http://homepages.www.archive.org/directory&gt;, because the full
          SURT prefix appears in subdomain URI SURT forms.</p></dd><dt><a name="toethreads"></a>Toe Threads</dt><dd><p>When crawling Heritrix employs a configurable number of Toe
