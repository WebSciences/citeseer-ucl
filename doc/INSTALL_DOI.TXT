DOI Server Installation Guide
IGC

To deploy the DOIServer utility, you will first need to install
Tomcat 6 with Axis 2, as well as a mysql database server.
Please refer to the Apache and mysql documentation
for instructions on how to install those applications.

Once that is complete, you can move on to the DOI service, which
you may have guessed by now is an Axis2 web service.

NOTE: It is perfectly reasonable for development purposes to
install the DOI Server in the same application container as the
CiteSeerX webapp, but for public deployments it is highly
preferable to maintain the DOI Server in a separate application
container in order to restrict access to trusted hosts only.  This
can be acheived by firewall configuration or iptables if using
Linux.  External clients will not require direct access to the
DOI Server application.

- Build the DOIServer distribution by executing 'ant doiserver'
  at the top-level of the distribution directory tree.

- First, install the DOI database on your mysql server.  To do this,
  go into the "install" directory and run 'perl installdb.pl'.  Make
  sure that the mysql command line utility is on your path before
  executing this script.

  You will be prompted to provide the necessary configuration and
  at the end you should have the necessary database installed.

- Edit the Tomcat server.xml, adding the following lines within the
  "<Host>" block, editing the bracketed strings to the appropriate
  values you specified during database installation:

    <Context path="/axis2" docBase="axis2" debug="5"
             reloadable="true" crossContext="true">
      <Resource name="jdbc/DOIDB"
                auth="Container"
                type="javax.sql.DataSource"
                maxActive="10"
                maxIdle="30"
                maxWait="10000"
                username="[CSX USER]"
                password="[CSX PASS]"
                driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
                url="jdbc:mysql://[HOST]:3306/csxdoi?autoReconnect=true"
      />
    </Context>

- Make sure that the mysql driver jar is in the lib directory of your
  Tomcat 6 installation.

- Copy the service package from dist/services/DOIServer/DOIServer.aar
  to the axis2 WEB-INF/services/ directory.

- The DOIServer should now be deployed.  You can test the installation by
  using the Axis2 web interface to make sure the service has been
  correctly registered and test the service directly using the perl client
  in src/perl/DOIClient.

  NOTE: Different versions of Axis seem to have different ideas about
  what namespaces should be generated.  If testing results in a failure
  something like:

    "invalid URN http://doi.citeseerx.psu.edu/xsd, expected
     http://doi.citeseerx.psu.edu"

  then don't worry, just change the "doi.namespace" parameter to the
  expected value and change the namespace in the client perl script
  as well.  Test again, with hopefully positive results.
