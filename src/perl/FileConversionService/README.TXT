FileConverter README
Isaac Councill

Check the FileConverter::Config module to make sure the settings
are correct.  You will probably need to obtain the PDFBox jar file
and reference it in Config.  It's better to use TET, but TET is
expensive.

If using PDFBox, make sure java is on your path.

I know this is sparse, more to come...
