/**
 * ConnectionPool manages client connections to a remote server host,
 * where connections are of type ObjectTransferConnection.  As new
 * connections are used, clients must return the connections to the pool
 * where they can be reused by other objects, increasing performance by
 * reducing the number of new connections that must be created.
 * 
 * Objects that lease connections must specify the amount of time they plan
 * to hold the object.  If the connection is not returned in time, it will
 * be destroyed.  Lease times can be extended by calling the renew method.
 * 
 * Idle connections are destroyed after expirationTime ms have passed.
 * 
 * If a call to shutdown() is made, the pool will stop accepting new
 * connections but it will continue to hold active connections until they are
 * returned or they time out.
